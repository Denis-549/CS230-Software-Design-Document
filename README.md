# CS230-Software-Design-Document-
The client company for this project is called “The Gaming Room”. The client is seeking to develop a web-based gaming application called ‘Draw It or Lose It’ that will run on multiple platforms based on their current game. Currently the game is only available on android app. The concept of a game in ‘Draw It or Lose It’ consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. In each game which will have the ability to have one or more teams consisting multiple players involved, drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark extendable by another 15-seconds (time limit) for other teams if a team fails to meet guessing conditions. A game will consist of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. The concept of the gaming application involves images being rendered from a large library of stock drawings as clues.

What I think I did best for this project was I identified the customers’ requirements and reflected those needs in the Software Design Template, such that every aspect of the project such as requirements, design constraints, rationale, as well as software design template eliminated any ambiguity in the effort to communicate this information and as well recommend solutions to address all or specific problem(s) to the client.

The one part of my work in all of the documents I created for this project that could use some additional revision is I think my recommendation and/or considerations and specific approach towards ensuring that memory and storage is effectively managed in the clients software application. There were some tricky parameters to stay within per clients’ request, as there were variables not to ignore on the side of end user (capacity/traffic etc.).  

Using a UML process flow diagram was the effective and easiest way to (graphically)  interpret the clients’ needs. Technical documentation, Business requirement Documents would have worked just as well but graphically representing the customers’ needs made it easier to identify constraints and propose solutions to the client easier and faster. Without the users’ needs not only would it have been practically impossible to build a satisfactory program, it would have likely been marred with flaws. Users’ needs allows developers to have an end users point of view in mind when designing and building a program. 

The first step towards designing or writing code is understanding the client’s problem. The one technique I think every developer should always employ is creating a summary of the task. It may not necessarily be an official executive summary, but a write-up of key elements/aspects of the project that clearly represent the clients’ business requirements. Process flow diagrams are also very important, as they will show business or technical constraints/drawbacks that may otherwise not be caught during coding.     


Kind regards,

Denis.
